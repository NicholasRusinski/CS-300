Problem Solving in the Project:
The problem being solved in this project seems to revolve around managing and organizing course information efficiently. It involves tasks such as loading course data from files, storing them in a structured manner (using a BST in this case), and providing functionalities to search for and display course information.

Approach to the Problem:
The approach taken involves understanding the requirements of the course planner, designing appropriate data structures (such as the Binary Search Tree for efficient searching and sorting), implementing functionalities to handle user interactions (menu options), and ensuring proper input validation and error handling.

Importance of Data Structures:
Understanding data structures is crucial for efficiently organizing and managing data in programs. In this project, the BST is used to efficiently store and retrieve course information, enabling quick searches and sorted outputs. Proper choice and implementation of data structures lead to more efficient and scalable solutions.

Overcoming Roadblocks:
Roadblocks encountered during the project might include understanding the requirements fully, designing the data structures and algorithms, handling file I/O operations, and implementing functionalities such as searching and sorting. Overcoming these challenges might involve breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks, seeking clarification when needed, and debugging/testing iteratively.

Evolution of Software Design Approach:
Working on this project likely expanded the approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of modularity, encapsulation, and reusability. Designing modular components, such as the Binary Search Tree class, allows for easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements. Moreover, implementing features like input validation and error handling enhances the robustness of the software.

Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs:
Through this project, developers likely learned the significance of writing clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand and maintain. Practices such as meaningful variable and function names, commenting, and adhering to coding standards contribute to code readability. Additionally, designing flexible and adaptable solutions enables easier modifications and enhancements in response to changing requirements or future extensions.
